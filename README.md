# HTMLify CLI

A beautiful full featured command line interface to download Scratch projects locally as HTML files.

## Usage:

```bash
# PNPM is better, but you do you
npm i -g htmlifycli

# It's interactive, just follow the prompts
htmlify
```

(oh also with this recording don't worry about the question mark loading things being weird, I fixed that)
